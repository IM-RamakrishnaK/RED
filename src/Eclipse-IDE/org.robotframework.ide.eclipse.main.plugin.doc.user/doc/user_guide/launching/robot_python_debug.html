<h2>Debugging Robot &amp; Python with RED &amp; PyDev </h2>

<p>From RED 0.7.6 it is possible to debug Robot test cases and Python libraries using RED together with PyDev in one RED/Eclipse instance.</p>
<p>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>RED 0.7.6 and newer
<li>PyDev installed to RED or Eclipse with RED and PyDev
<li>Download runPyDevDebug.py script from GitHub: </p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Environment Setup:</h3>
<ul>
<li>install PyDev to RED or Eclipse instance where RED is installed if not already installed.
<li>set Python nature to Robot project to be debugged - right click on Project,from PyDev menu select set Python nature
<li>set port for remote PyDev debugger: <i>Preferences -> PyDev -> Debug -> Port for remote debugger</i>
<li>for convenience Remote debugger server activation can be changed from Manual to Keep always on: <i>Preferences -> PyDev -> Debug -> Remote debugger server activation</i>.
<li>to use runPyDevDebug.py script logic, RED needs to pass parameters separated by space to external script. check <i>Window -> Preferences -> RobotFramework -> XXXX</i></p>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Script runPyDevDebug.py update:</h3>
<ul>
<li>PyDev debugger, <i>pydevd.py</i> path needs to be specified, this can be done in two ways. You can install pydevd by pip ( <i>pip install pydevd </i>) therefore script will use it straight away, alternatively update <i>pathToPyDevD</i> variable, pydevd is usually located inside PyDev RED/Eclipse under plugins/org.python.pydev/pysrc/pydevd.py
<li>if PyDev port for remote debugger was changed, variable <i>pydevdPort</i> needs to be updated
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Debug configuration setup:</h3>
<ul> 
<li>open Debug Configuration,create new Robot Debug configuration</li>
<li>in Robot tab, populate Project name,test suites to be debugged with all other relevant information</li>
<li>in Executor tab, in Executable file provide path to Python interpreter ( for instance <i>c:\Python27\python.exe</i> on Windows or <i>/usr/bin/python</i> on Linux)</li>
<li>in Additional executable file arguments field provide path to <i>runPyDevDebug.py</i> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Debug configuration template:</h3>
<ul>
<li>custom Robot Debug configuration created above will work for preconfigured test cases, this may not be convenient enough if you need to often switch test cases and projects.This can be avoided by defining default launch configuration template which will be used later anytime when user press Run or Debug
<li>Provide the same paths as from Executor Tab to Default Launch Configurations under <i>Windows -> Preferences -> RobotFramework -> Launching -> Default Launch Configuration </i>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Debug:</h3>
<ul>
<li>remember to place at least one breakpoint on executable line either in Robot test or Python library
<li>before running custom Debug Configuration, PyDev Debug server needs to be started if the startup was not changed to Automatic in Environment Setup part. Switch to Debug perspective, from PyDev menu,select Start Debug Server
<li>run created Debug Configuration, RED should start the runPydevDebug.py script which will take command line from RED and start Robot Framework debug run simultaneously being connected with Pydev Debugger. 
<li>if breakpoint is reached, appropriated Debugger is used depending on the source from where the breakpoint was reached (either Robot testcase or Python library)

</ul></p>
