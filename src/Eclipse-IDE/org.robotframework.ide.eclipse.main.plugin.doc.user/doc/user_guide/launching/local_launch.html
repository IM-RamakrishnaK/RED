	<h2>Locally launched tests</h2>
	
	<p>When <b>Robot</b> launch configuration is launched it setups a simple server inside your RED instance to which 
	execution events can be send from tests. Then it automatically starts the tests choosing suites/tests which
	has to be executed from the configuration. The tests are either started using some kind of python interpreter
	or using <a href="local_launch_scripting.html">user-defined script</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Robot launch configuration</h3>
	
	<p>Open 
	<a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenRunConfigurations')">
	Run -> Run Configurations...</a> dialog and under <b>Robot</b> element create new configuration. The
	configuration itself is using couple of tabs:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Robot</b> - where <b>project in use</b> should be specified, as well as <b>suites</b> and/or 
		<b>tests</b> to be executed; <b>tags</b> used to include or exclude tests and <b>additional</b> 
		arguments provided by user,
		</li>
		<li><b>Listener</b> - where agent connection type and its parameters is specified,
		</li>
		<li><b>Executor</b> - where executable for the tests are specified - it can be either python
		installation used by the project; python installation taken from <code>PATH</code> variable, or
		any script selected by user, 
		<li><b>Environment</b> - where environment variables for robot process can be specified (if nothing is
		specified the variables are inherited from RED/eclipse environment variables).
	</ul>
