	<h2>Launching related UI elements</h2>
	
	<p>RED provides couple of elements which are used in order to launch test and communicate with
	them when they are running. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Launching tests</h3>
	
	<p>Launch configuration has to be created to launch Robot tests. This can be done either manually
	or automatically e.g. when launching tests from <b>Project Explorer</b> or from <b>Suite Editor</b>.
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Launch Configuration dialog</b> - open launch configurations dialog (via 
		<a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenRunConfigurations')">
		Run -> Run Configurations...</a> or
		<a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations')">
		Run -> Debug Configurations...</a> menu) and create new configuration under <i>Robot</i> or
		<i>Robot Remote</i> element. For detailed description of both configurations and their possible 
		attributes read <a href="local_launch.html">Local launches</a> or 
		<a href="remote_launch.html">Remote launches</a> topic. After creating the configuration it can be launched
		manually by clicking <b>Run</b>/<b>Debug</b> button.

		</li>
		
		<li><b>From launching history</b> - launch already existing and previously launched configuration. This 
		is possible either from top level <b>Run</b> menu or from launching toolbar as depicted on images below:
		<p>

			<img src="images/ui_launch_history_1.png"/>
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Whole suites from Project Explorer</b> - launch tests for given suite(s). It can be either
		whole folder containing other suites or simple a suite file. RED will try to find already existing
		configuration basing on selected items and launch it or it will create new default one for given
		this selection and then launch it.

		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Selected tests from Project Explorer</b> - similarly as above configuration for only selected
		tests inside some suite can be launched by clicking on tests inside particular suite file.
		<p>

		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Selected tests from Suite Editor</b> - selected tests can also be launched straight from Suite
		Editor either in Test Cases page or in Source page. Use context menu or designated keyboard shortcut
		to perform launch.

	<h3>Console view</h3>
	
	<p>Console view is standard view provided by eclipse platform. RED is using in to display output of 
	the tests launch. In case of locally launched tests it displays standard output and standard error 
	(<i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i>) of process which runs the test. It also
	contains a header in which command line call and Robot version is shown. Remotely
	launched tests do not send those streams to RED, so in this case only messages about remote server
	status are displayed. 
	</p>

	<dl class="note">
	   <dt>Note</dt>
	   <dd>You may notice that some links are clickable in output of tests - for example locations of 
		Output/Log/Report files as well as location of argument file (if in use). You can use them to 
		open the files right inside RED.</dd>
