	<h2>RED Agent</h2>
	
	<p>RED Tests Runner Agent is something of which you should be aware if you're planning 
	to launch tests using remote configuration or if you're writing own script which will
	run the tests in local configuration. The agent is a python script
	which should be attached to test execution as a listener (see 
	<a target="_blank" class="external"  href="http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#listener-interface">
	Listener interface
	</a> topic in RF User Guide).
	</p>
	
	<p>Agent is responsible for listening to execution events happening in running tests, so without agent
	both <b>Message Log</b> and <b>Execution</b> views will not work. The script is also responsible for
	stopping/resuming tests on breakpoints, so RED debugging capabilities also only work when agent 
	was injected into tests execution.
	</p>

	   <dd>You can always obtain agent script from RED within Preferences dialog
	   (at <i><a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.launch.default)')">
	   Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Robot Framework-&gt;Default Launch Configurations
	   </a></i>, use <b>Export Client Script</b> button).

	<dl class="warning">
	   <dt>Warning</dt>
	   <dd>Agent script is a subject of changes, so it may happen that script exported from RED version
	   <span class="code">x</span> is not able to work properly with RED version <span class="code">y</span> and 
	   vice versa. From version <span class="code">0.7.6</span> onwards both script and RED are checking and handling
	   this when establishing connection, so you will be notified. <b>Important</b>: script taken from RED older than 
	   <span class="code">0.7.6</span> will not work with newer RED and vice-versa without notifying you
	   (possibly even hanging infinitely).
