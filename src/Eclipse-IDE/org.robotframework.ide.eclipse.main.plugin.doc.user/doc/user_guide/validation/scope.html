<h2>Limiting validation scope</h2>

<p>When working with bigger projects, it is good to limit validation scope to folders relevant to current work to 
speed up validation and reduce test error markers to be relevant to files under scope.
</p>

<p>Excluded folders are still parsed so code completion is preserved, just validation is omitted thus validation 
errors and warnings are skipped for excluded folders.
</p>

<p>Include/exclude can be triggered in Project Explorer under right click menu on selected folders:</p>

<p>Include/exclude can also be found in red.xml editor under Validation table - include/exclude action is available 
as right click menu.
</p>

<p>In case of big amounts of .txt or .tsv files which are not Robot test cases, validation can be excluded on files 
bigger than size threshold.</p>

<p>Note that exclude folders are grayed out, exclude state is inherited from parent folders.
