<h2>GTK3 issues under Linux</h2>
It was observed that using GTK3 library with Eclipse causes unexpected graphical glitches.<br>
Those glitches are system independent although occurs more often under Debian and Ubuntu than RedHat<br>
Most annoying one is screen flickering when editing large file with multiple folding sections in source editor.<br>
Also some of the right click actions in red.xml are not activated.<br>
<br>
It is recommended to switch to GTK2 when working under Linux.<br>
<br>
RED Product for Linux has configuration to use GTK2,Eclipse users should check and change,if necessary, to GTK2.<br>
<h3>Verifying current GTK version used</h3>
GTK version can be checked in Eclipse under <i>Help-&gtInstallation Details-&gtConfiguration</i>,search for <i>org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.version</i> entry.
<h3>Setting GTK2 system wide</h3>
In console execute following:<br>
<i>export SWT_GTK3=0</i> <br>
than start eclipse:<br>
<i>./eclipse</i> <br>
<h3>Setting GTK2 in eclipse.ini</h3>
GTK2 can be forced for eclipse instance,edit eclipse.ini to include following 2 lines above -vmargs section: <br>
<i>--launcher.GTK_version</br>
2</i></br>
