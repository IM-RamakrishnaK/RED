  <h2>RED Preferences & red.xml and other</h2>
  This page is intended to help users in following cases: <br>
	<ul>
	<li>set custom Python & Robot instance in multiple Python environment for workspace or project wide usage</li>
	<li>include external resource files to be seen in content assistance and validation</li>
	</ul>
  
  
  <h3> Preferences </h3>
  Editor preferences are stored together with other Eclipse settings, all of them are shared across <b>active workspace</b>.<br>
  Preferences can be found in toolbar menu <i>Window -> Preferences -> Robot Framework </i><br>
  One of the most important item in multiple python environment is setting active Python and RobotFramework instances to be used for running and debugging.<br>
  If you need to use different Pythons & Robots in various projects, this can be done editing red.xml in respective project<br><br>

  <h3> Preferences in red.xml </h3>
  Red.xml file is place with Project respective preferences, it is not shared with other projects. It is always created during project creation process in RED.<br>
  It provides information about external libraries and variables used in Project so RED can generate libraries documentation used in content assistance and validation. <br>
  If RED Robot Editor does not provide you content help or validation suggests that library is not visible, it is good to have a look into red.xml<br>
  When library is included in red.xml, documentation is automatic generated by RED<br><br>

  <b>In current releases there is no transparent and automatic way of including variables and libraries files </b> to red.xml file so user action is required any time when new external library and variable file is included in settings of testcase file. <br><br>
  Red.xml file opened with RED Project Editor should look like follows:
