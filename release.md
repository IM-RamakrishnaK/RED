- #48 - fix for Debugger not working if :FOR in main suite __init__ file
- #49 - fix for Running sinlge test not possible if eclipse project named different than main test directory.
- #52 - extend_pythonpath.py script doesn't support pth files directories to be modules

## What's in the package
- Robot Perspective & Robot nature (Project,files and other file artefacts)
- Text Source editor with syntax coloring, code assistance and real-time validation
- Table editors synced with Source
- Debug Perspective for test case debugging with breakpoints, stepping, variable watch
- Remote debug
- Support for dictionaries & lists
- Eclipse help
- File support: .robot, .txt, .tsv

## Known issues
- Under Ubuntu/Xubuntu it was discovered that NullPointerException is shown when opening file from Project Explorer and clicking on file structure instead of file name. As a workaround open file by clicking on filename. 
- Cannot delete library by right click of mouse in red.xml under Ubuntu/Mint. Use Delete key as workaround
- GTK3 seems to mess up with Eclipse under Linux. Force usage of GTK2 by executing command in terminal: export SWT_GTK3=0

- RED feature - Eclipse does not have UTF-8 support in editors by default. Check Preferences and RED help to get how to change it. 

## Short term plans
- Usability improvements & comments formatting in table editors


## Notes
By default, Eclipse is shipped with limited heap size which impacts performance while working with bigger projects. It is recommended to increase Xmx and Xmx parameters to higher values. Memory allocation can be done via startup arguments or by editing eclipse.ini in Eclipse folder.
We recommend to set following lines to eclipse.ini :
```
-vmargs
-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m
```
For details visit Eclipse Wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F

## Feedback
We would appreciate any feedback about RED - Robot Editor, especially in every day functions like editors usability, false positive validation errors, problem with source parsing& coloring, performance etc. We are open for improvements and new functionalities. Fell free to create issue in GitHub issue tracker.
